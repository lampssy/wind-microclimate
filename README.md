# Automated Wind Microclimate Assessments
Python application automating the setup, running and post-processing multiple CFD simulations for the purpose of Wind Microclimate Assessments. The software uses OpenFOAM as a CFD solver and ParaView for generating the visualizations. Resultant colour map of wind comfort categories is based on simulation results and provided historical weather data for a given location.

The whole assessment process is in line with "London Wind Microclimate Guidelines" by the City of London [1].
